This is my Capstone project made for the Fall 2020 quarter of Neumont College of Computer Science. This was made from idea to product within a 10 week period using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, and Pug. MySQL is used as the database.

The idea of this project is a web application that lets teachers, primarily those at the elementary level, easily communicate and give feedback of students to a student's parents.
